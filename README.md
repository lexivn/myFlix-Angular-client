# MyFlixAngularClient

Welcome to MovieApiAngularClient, a portfolio project showcasing my skills in building Angular applications. This project serves as a client for the Movie API, displaying movie data with a user-friendly interface using Angular Material.

## Overview

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.1.
+Angular Version: 17.13.1
+Angular CLI Version: 17.3.1

## Project Higlights

**Single page application (SPA):** The application follows a single-page application (SPA), interacting with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.
**Google Material Design:** Use Angular Material for a visually appealng and responsive design.

## Technoligues Used

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
